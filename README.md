# [TP 201](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan/blob/master/courses/rust/README.md): Practical Networked Applications in Rust.

## Rust Programming

This series is core to [TALENT-PLAN](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan). It builds your understanding of Rust as a programming language and provides opportunities for you to practice with it.

[TP 201: Practical Networked Applications in Rust](https://github.com/pingcap/talent-plan/blob/master/courses/rust/README.md). A series of projects that incrementally develop a single Rust project from the ground up into a high-performance, networked, parallel and asynchronous key/value store. Along the way various real-world Rust development subject matter are explored and discussed.
